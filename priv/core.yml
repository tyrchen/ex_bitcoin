items:
  - name: GetBestBlockHash
    description: returns the header hash of the most recent block on the best block chain.

  - name: GetBlock
    description: gets a block with a particular header hash from the local block database either as a JSON object or as a serialized block. Updated in 0.13.0

  - name: GetBlockChainInfo
    description: provides information about the current state of the block chain. Updated in 0.12.1

  - name: GetBlockCount
    description: returns the number of blocks in the local best block chain.

  - name: GetBlockHash
    description: returns the header hash of a block at the given height in the local best block chain.

  - name: GetBlockHeader
    description: gets a block header with a particular header hash from the local block database either as a JSON object or as a serialized block header. New in 0.12.0

  - name: GetChainTips
    description: returns information about the highest-height block (tip) of each local block chain.

  - name: GetDifficulty
    description: returns the proof-of-work difficulty as a multiple of the minimum difficulty.

  - name: GetMemPoolAncestors
    description: returns all in-mempool ancestors for a transaction in the mempool. New in 0.13.0

  - name: GetMemPoolDescendants
    description: returns all in-mempool descendants for a transaction in the mempool. New in 0.13.0

  - name: GetMemPoolEntry
    description: returns mempool data for given transaction (must be in mempool). New in 0.13.0

  - name: GetMemPoolInfo
    description: returns information about the node’s current transaction memory pool. Updated in 0.12.0

  - name: GetRawMemPool
    description: returns all transaction identifiers (TXIDs) in the memory pool as a JSON array, or detailed information about each transaction in the memory pool as a JSON object. Updated in 0.13.0

  - name: GetTxOut
    description: returns details about a transaction output. Only unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) are guaranteed to be available.

  - name: GetTxOutProof
    description: returns a hex-encoded proof that one or more specified transactions were included in a block. New in 0.11.0

  - name: GetTxOutSetInfo
    description: returns statistics about the confirmed unspent transaction output (UTXO) set. Note that this call may take some time and that it only counts outputs from confirmed transactions—it does not count outputs from the memory pool.

  - name: PreciousBlock
    description: treats a block as if it were received before others with the same work. New in 0.14.0

  - name: PruneBlockChain
    description: prunes the blockchain up to a specified height or timestamp. New in 0.14.0

  - name: VerifyChain
    description: verifies each entry in the local block chain database.

  - name: VerifyTxOutProof
    description: verifies that a proof points to one or more transactions in a block, returning the transactions the proof commits to and throwing an RPC error if the block is not in our best block chain. New in 0.11.0
